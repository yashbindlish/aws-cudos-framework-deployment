# Cloud Anomaly Dashboards (CUDOS Framework)

## Introduction

AWS Cost Anomaly Detection uses advanced Machine Learning to identify anomalous spend and root causes, empowering the customers to take action quickly. To make it easier for them to identify any sudden spike in the spends, they can visualize the insights into those anomalous spends across multiple accounts using Amazon QuickSight that retrieves and refreshes the data periodically.
